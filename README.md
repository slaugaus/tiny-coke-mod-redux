# Overview

Recreating a tiny Minecraft mod I made in MCreator using the actual Forge MDK. Also my first time using Java.

"Tiny Coke" is a mod that lets you break a piece of [Immersive Engineering]()'s Coal Coke into 16 little clumps that smelt exactly 1 item when used in a furnace. Because you can't use 16 items in a crafting recipe, you can also make "Half Coke" which smelts 8 items like normal coal does. 

The modding community has a stigma around using MCreator, so I wanted to correct my "wrongdoing" and port the mod to 1.19.4 the "right" way. Also I can put Java on my resume now.

# Development Environment

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (student license) with assorted plugins/themes

Programmed in Java (17) using the [Minecraft Forge 1.19.4 "MDK" (Mod Dev. Kit) template](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.19.4.html)

# Future Work

- I couldn't find any other mods that add coal coke, but I want to include "Ore Dictionary" compatibility (or whatever the modern equivalent is) so that any coal coke can be used.
- I made a "hilarious" resource pack involving Coca-Cola that I should update
- Actually build and release the darn thing...
- Port to more versions and Fabric
